    Intellectual disability originates before the age of eighteen (18). People with this disability experience significant limitations in two main areas: 1) intellectual functioning and 2) adaptive behavior. These limitations are expressed in the person’s conceptual, social, and practical everyday living skills. A number of people with intellectual disability are mildly affected, making the disability difficult to recognize without visual cues. Intellectual disability is diagnosed through the use of standardized tests of intelligence and adaptive behavior. Individuals with intellectual disability who are provided appropriate personalized supports over a sustained period generally have improved life outcomes. In fact, many adults with an intellectual disability can live independent, productive lives in the community with support from family, friends and local agencies.

    When we speak about intellectual delay, a child tends to have an intelligence score of 69 or less which falls into the range of Impaired. Don’t let this scare you as there are a few reasons a child could have a low score and MANY people with mild intellectual delay CAN lead independent lives. Also, a child CAN have a lower IQ but still not be truly intellectually delayed. I explain processing speed in my post on this site. If you have a child with a highly impaired processing speed, but a fairly intact working memory, it is possible that your child may not be truly intellectually delayed even if they have a lower IQ.
